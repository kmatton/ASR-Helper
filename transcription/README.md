This directory contains scripts to help with normalizing the notation used in transcriptions of audio files.
It may be useful to normalize transcriptions (either human generated or produced by an ASR model) before using them to train
ASR models or to compute the performance of ASR models.

To standardize your transcriptions, use the script standardize_transcriptions.py. Details on the arguments to provide to this script
are listed within the script.
