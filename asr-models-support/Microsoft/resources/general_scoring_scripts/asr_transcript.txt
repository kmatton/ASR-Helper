/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_personal/subject_1815001/call_19237/segment_44.wav ah kind of bins to little adam
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_personal/subject_1815001/call_19237/segment_50.wav um i'd say
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_personal/subject_1815001/call_19237/segment_51.wav pretty much most of the time probably five or six days
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_personal/subject_1815001/call_19237/segment_52.wav um let's see
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_personal/subject_1815001/call_19237/segment_53.wav middle name and three four
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_personal/subject_1815001/call_19237/segment_64.wav mhm um how i got my homework as far as being doing that creatively
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_personal/subject_1815001/call_19237/segment_7.wav um no not really
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_assessment/subject_1815001/call_19253/segment_11.wav that's then um i just added and then my brother's not speaking in that showing up to it um things he said he'd show up to
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_assessment/subject_1815001/call_19253/segment_24.wav so she's it anyhow i figure what better time to use is in that
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_assessment/subject_1815001/call_19253/segment_26.wav i've been dealing um
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_assessment/subject_1815001/call_19253/segment_29.wav try to rest in the muscles won't
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_assessment/subject_1815001/call_19253/segment_34.wav i really haven't had one um i make myself eat at least one meal

/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_assessment/subject_1815001/call_19253/segment_80.wav and it's been sporadic throughout i mean i think it's because i have
/nfs/turbo/McInnisLab/Soheil/IS2018_priori_emotion/priori_emotion_db/wav/exp_assessment/subject_1815001/call_19253/segment_83.wav i have told my mother she gets out and she's able to walk from the couch to the toilet and from the toilet to the bad i am still taking some sort of vacation in february
